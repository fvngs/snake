open source ultrasimplistic snake game



## faq

#### how do i get textures?

i'm working on making my own texture pack but for now there are no official textures due to copyright

#### how do i change the snake speed, colors, etc.?

most modding can be done through constants.py where most things are pretty self explanatory, however there's a very simple modding framework to edit practically anything in the game


## roadmap

- add a modding and skinning framework

- infinite mode with expanding canvas
